## clean arch in nestjs 

on v1 i actually want to use prisma orm, but i dont find a way to make the abstract repository pattern for that. But because still curious i find a way to implement prisma abstrac repository pattern. 

on v2 i implement:
1. clean arch
2. service layer
3. repository pattern
4. new structure
